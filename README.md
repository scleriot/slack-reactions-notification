## Use your own Slack application

If for privacy reason you want to use your own Slack application, you'll need to:
* create a classic app (in order to use the RTM API)
* deployed a small Node.js server to initiate OAuth2 authentication
* build the electron app

### 1. Create your Slack app 

Follow this link to create your app: https://api.slack.com/apps?new_classic_app=1

In the OAuth section, set the Redirect URLs to:
* http://localhost:4242/callback (for development purposes)
* https://YOUR_DOMAIN/callback (your small node production server)

Set the following scopes:
* channels:history
* channels:read
* reactions:read
* users.profile:read

### 2. Deploy the Node.js server

Node.js server code is located in the *node/* folder.
Deploy the app, and create a .env file in the node/ folder with your app credentials:
```
SLACK_CLIENT_ID=***
SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET=***
SLACK_REDIRECT_URI=http://***/callback
```

### 3. Build the web extension

Create a .env file at the root of the project with the Node server URI:
```
SLACK_OAUTH_URL=http://localhost:4242
```

Run `npm run build` to build the extension.
